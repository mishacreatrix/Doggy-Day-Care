## Date: Dec 2017

## Project Goal:

I created this webpage with the goal of it to be used as a landing page for a doggy day care business or similar. I had been thinking about creating a dog themed website for some time now and I finally put pen to paper and created this webpage. I wanted to create something simple and professional to showcase my web design and development skills and felt this would achieve that.

## Creative Strategy:

As the main goal of this project was to showcase my skills as a web designer / developer, I took on the challenge of creating all of the design assets myself – the icons in Illustrator.

I chose a vibrant multi-colored color scheme for this webpage to convey a fun and active place to bring your dog, which I believe is very effective in this case.

## Tools Used:

* Good old pen and paper to jot down initial requirements and design rough wireframes etc.
* Sublime text 3 as a text editor and the Bootstrap design framework.
* Adobe Illustrator – To design the design assets required.
* Adobe Photoshop – To enhance the images as required.
* Chrome developer tools etc – To test the website out on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

## Website Features:

* Fully custom made web page created using the Bootstrap design framework
* Custom made images enhanced in Photoshop, custom made icons created in Illustrator by Mishacreatrix
* Contact form
* Fully responsive web page
